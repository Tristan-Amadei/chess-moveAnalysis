# chess-moveAnalysis

The goal of this project is to train a small AI to play chess. This idea is to analyse a database of games played by masters, and create metric for each move played in each game. </b>
The database we'll use can be found there: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/milesh1/35-million-chess-games
